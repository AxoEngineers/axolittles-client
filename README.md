This is the frontend for the axoquarium game: https://axoquarium.axolittles.io/

It's not entirely clear to me how this repo integrates with `axolittles-master-server`. My guess is that this client is built into binaries and then uploaded into the `axolittles-master-server/game/` directory. Please let me know if you have any thoughts.
